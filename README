autopac is a simple software installation and update script written for
POSIX compliant shells. It acts as an autonomous and portable script for
package managers on most popular operating systems.

-- Operating systems and their supported package managers --
	Linux distros	apt, dnf, pacman, apk
	FreeBSD		    pkg
	OpenBSD		    pkg_add
	Other		    flatpak, snap

To install software, users add the package names (with spaces in between)
to the "software.txt" file and use autopac -i. This allows them to
install all the software they need without having to manually type it
out on each system.
